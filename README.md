# 🏦 Loan Default Risk - XGBoost Model with SHAP Explainability

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on a loan using the Default Risk dataset.

The model leverages **XGBoost for classification and uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret feature contributions.
