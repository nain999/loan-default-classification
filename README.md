# 🏦 Home Credit Default Risk - XGBoost Model with SHAP Explainability

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on a loan using the [Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk).

The model leverages **XGBoost for classification and uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret feature contributions.
